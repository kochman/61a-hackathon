A chat program that runs as a Tor hidden service. Clients connect to the hidden service anonymously.

The Tor hidden service may take up to a minute to show up. The interface tries to refresh the message list every 4 seconds.

Requires Tor and the Stem control library.

USAGE

python3 chattor.py

python3 chattor.py --prefix KEY_PREFIX

If KEY_PREFIX is specified, Chattor will try to create an Onion public key with it using Shallot.

The Shallot in this repo is built for OS X, so please build it for your architecture if you must: https://github.com/katmagic/Shallot
